## Legal FAQs

### Does Scholarly Space comply with COPPA (Child Online Privacy Protection Act)?

Yes. The FTC has specifically stated that COPPA's requirements do not apply to sites that contract with schools to offer online programs for the benefit of the schools and their students, and collect personal information only for these purposes. (FTC COPPA FAQ #55.) Thus, these services are not required to get prior verifiable parental consent before collecting or maintaining personal information. Scholarly Space, LLC's services are offered pursuant to Scholarly Space, LLC's contracts with school districts, and Scholarly Space, LLC does not collect personal information for other purposes. The FTC has said that in such circumstances, operators like Scholarly Space, LLC may presume that the school has authorized the collection of personal information based upon the school having obtained the parents' consent. Schools often obtain parental consent via Acceptable Use Policies that they provide to students and parents. In addition, COPPA also allows, but does not require, schools to act as agents on behalf of parents and to provide consent for the online collection of a student's personal information within the school context. (FTC COPPA FAQ #54.)

### Does Scholarly Space comply with FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act)?

Yes. Scholarly Space, LLC is compliant with FERPA. Scholarly Space expects and suggests that institutions comply with FERPA's notice requirements regarding the use and disclosure of directory and non-directory education records so that students and parents are aware that the school may engage services like Scholarly Space. Institutions are free to inspect or audit our services to assure themselves that all information is used only for the purposes of assisting instructors. Data is kept secure at all times.

### Does Scholarly Space comply with P.A. 16-189 (An Act Concerning Student Data Privacy)?
