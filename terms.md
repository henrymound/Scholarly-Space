You retain all ownership rights you have in any User Submissions. Scholarly Space does not claim any ownership rights in the User Submissions.

In order to allow Scholarly Space to provide the Service, you hereby grant to us a limited, non-exclusive, sublicensable (as necessary to perform the Service), worldwide, royalty-free, and transferable (only to a successor) right and license to (i) use, copy, store, distribute, publicly perform and display, modify, and create derivative works (such as changes we make so that your content works better with our Service) such User Submissions as necessary to provide, improve and make the Service available to you and other users, including through any future media in which the Service may be distributed, (ii) use and disclose metrics and analytics regarding the User Submissions in an aggregate or other non-personally identifiable manner (including, for use in improving our service or in marketing and business development purposes), (iii) use any User Submission (including any Education Record) that has been de-identified for any product development, research or other purpose; and (iv) use for other purposes permitted by the Scholarly Space [Privacy Policy][2].

## Additional Terms by User Type

### Students:

if you are a student accessing the Service at the invitation of a teacher or other school official, the following terms apply to you.   

  i. Only students who have been invited, or given access to the Service, by their teacher, school, or district may use the Service. You may not access or use the Service unless you are invited or given access to the Service by a teacher, school, or district who is authorized to give you access to the Service.
  
  ii. We request minimal personal information to be provided from students to sign up for an account on the Service: username, password, and age or date or birth. If you are under 13 years of age, we also collect your parent's email address so that we can provide notice or obtain consent for you to use the Service. If you are a student, please do not provide any personal information about yourself to us, other than what we request from you when you sign up for the Service or as directed by your teacher, school or district.
  
  iii. The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") prohibits online service providers from knowingly collecting personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age without verifiable parental consent or notice as applicable ("Consent"). Consent may be obtained either by 1) Scholarly Space if the student is setting up a student account; or 2) a student's school if utilizing certain features of the Service without setting up an account. Children under the age of 13 are prohibited from using certain features of the Service without Consent. For that reason, the signup flow for the Service requests the age of each new student user. By registering, you promise that you provided your real age during your signup, and you are either (a) over the age of 13 or (b) you gave us your parent or legal guardian's actual and current email address, and that any response sent to Company in response comes from your parent or legal guardian.

### Teachers and school leaders

If you are a teacher, school leader, aide, or other similar personnel ("School Personnel") accessing the Service on behalf of a school, school district, or other similar educational institution (the "Institution"), the following terms apply to you:

  i. You agree that you are acting on behalf of (or have permission from) your Institution to enter into this Agreement and to use the Service as part of your curriculum.
  
  ii. You further understand and acknowledge that COPPA prohibits online service providers from knowingly collecting personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age without Consent and you understand that we will not let children under the age of 13 use certain features of the Service unless:

    1. Scholarly Space obtains Consent from the child's parent or legal guardian if the student is creating an account on Scholarly Space; or
    2. You obtain Consent in the situations where the child is not creating an account, but you as School Personnel allow the child to access certain features of Scholarly Space which may result in the collection of personal information from the child ("School Consent"). Scholarly Space will not provide full access or use of the Service to children under the age of 13 that you invite or allow access to the Service if we are unable to obtain parental consent or learn that School Personnel or the Institution has not obtained School Consent.
  
  iii. School Consent. You acknowledge and agree that when School Consent must be utilized to allow children under 13 to use the Service, you and/or the Institution will be solely responsible (and hereby agree that Scholarly Space is not responsible) for compliance with COPPA. This includes without limitation, limiting access to the Service to those student users from whom School Personnel has received valid Consent forms and complying with all parental requests regarding the collection, use and disclosure of such parent's child's information. School Personnel or the Institution are responsible for disseminating parental consent forms to the parents of potential student users, for confirming receipt of valid consent forms for each child before granting the student access to the Service, and for retaining such consent forms on file. If a parent user does not consent or rescinds such School Consent, School Personnel or the Institution shall immediately notify Scholarly Space to discontinue that student's access to the Service and ensure that such student's information is no longer accessible through the Services. For more information on School Consent please see our FAQ.

  iv. Only School Personnel who are current employees of the Institution may use the Service on the Institution's behalf. Upon termination of a teacher or other staff member's employment with the Institution, such individual must return and cease using all login details and student access he or she has in his or her possession. If at any time you learn a user of the Service claims to be affiliated with your Institution who is not, in fact, affiliated with your Institution, you will notify Company immediately.

### Parents

If you are a parent of a student that has been invited to create an account on the Service or is given access to the Service by School Personnel, then the following terms apply to you:

  i. If your child is under the age of 13, Consent must be given in order for a student to use certain features of a Scholarly Space student account. This Consent may be obtained either from 1) Scholarly Space if the student is setting up a student account; or 2) a student's School Personnel if utilizing certain features of the Service without setting up an account. If you are the parent or legal guardian of a child who has created an account with us and you did not receive an email seeking your Consent, you can email us at [privacy@scholarly.space][1] to have that child's account deleted. Please note, that if you as a parent provide an email to School Personnel when the school is obtaining School Consent, we may send an email asking you to verify your child's account, but you will not receive any other emails unless you have opted in to email marketing or have separately created an account on our Service.
  
  Information collected from students (including personal information and information collected automatically) is never used or disclosed for third-party advertising or any kind of first- or third-party behaviorally-targeted advertising, and personal information is never sold or rented to anyone, including marketers or advertisers. See our [Privacy Policy][2] for more details.

  ii. You further agree that we may send you messages, alerts, and other communications through the Service, including via email, web alert, text messages, push notifications and other similar means, in accordance with the preferences you set through the Service, and you agree to accept such messages, and pay any applicable network access, data usage, or similar fees.

## FERPA

Certain information that may be provided to Scholarly Space by School Personnel that is directly related to a student and maintained by an Institution, may be considered an education record ("Education Record") under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ("FERPA"). Additionally, certain information, provided to Company by School Personnel about a student, such as student name and grade level, may be considered directory information under FERPA ("Directory Information") and thus not an Education Record. A school may not generally disclose personally identifiable information from an eligible student's education records to a third party without written consent of the parent and/or eligible student or without meeting one of the exemptions set forth in FERPA ("FERPA Exemption(s)"), including the exemption for Directory Information ("Directory Information Exemption") or disclosure to school officials with a legitimate educational interest ("School Official Exemption").

As School Personnel or an Institution providing Directory Information or any Education Record to Scholarly Space, you represent, warrant and covenant to Scholarly Space, as applicable, that your Institution has:

  i. complied with the Directory Information Exemption, including, without limitation, informing parents and eligible students what information the Institution deems to be directory information and allowing parents and eligible students a reasonable amount of time to request that schools not disclose directory information about them; and/or

  ii. complied with the School Official Exemption, including, without limitation, informing parents in their annual notification of FERPA rights that the Institution defines "school official" to include service providers and defines "legitimate educational interest" to include services such as the type provided by Scholarly Space; or
  
  iii. obtained all necessary parental or eligible student written consent to share the Directory Information and Educational Records with Company, in each case, solely to enable Company's operation of the Service.

Scholarly Space will never share Education Records with third parties except (i) as directed by a Scholarly Space user (i.e., teacher sharing with another teacher or parent); or (ii) to our service providers that are necessary for us to provide the Service, as stated in our [Privacy Policy][2]. A list of our current essential service providers is located here. Education Records are never used or disclosed for third party advertising or any kind of first- or third-party behaviorally-targeted advertising to students or parents. Additionally, information collected directly from a student using Scholarly Space is never used or disclosed for third party advertising, or any kind of first- or third-party behaviorally-targeted advertising to the student, and personal information collected from a student is never sold or rented to anyone. This section shall not be construed (i) to prohibit Scholarly Space from marketing or advertising directly to parents so long as the marketing or advertising did not result from the use of Educational Records to provide behaviorally targeted advertising or (ii) to limit the ability of Scholarly Space to use student information or Educational Records for adaptive learning or customized student learning purposes.

Scholarly Space may use Education Records that have been de-identified for product development, research or other purposes ("De-Identified Data"). De-Identified Data will have all direct and indirect personal identifiers removed, this includes, but is not limited to, name, date of birth, demographic information, location information and school identity. Scholarly Space agrees not to attempt to re-identify the De-Identified Data and not to transfer the De-Identified Data to a third party unless that party agrees not to attempt re-identification.
