<h1><strong>What Makes Scholarly Space Great</strong></h1>

<h3>A Self-Incentivizing and Dynamic Portfolio</h3> 
Scholarly Space doesn't only allow users to keep track of and organize their school-based academic pursuits. Our proprietary user-friendly portfolio interface allows users to freely add their own personal works, work experiences, independent studies, and miscellaneous projects. Scholarly Space is the only online portfolio users will ever need, granting them complete control over what to include or omit in their online portfolio.  Scholarly Space is tailored to individuals; it is the online home for artists, writers, scientists, engineers, inventors, and entrepreneurs alike. <br>

Our online portfolio is designed to be dynamic, just like our users. Unlike traditional online portfolios, Scholarly Space is not just an editable resume template. An individual's work cannot be constrained to a piece of paper. At Scholarly Space, users can intuitively shape and traverse their boundless visual web of works. Our software facilitates the unique. Users can upload artwork, photographs, essays, news articles, music, blogs, programming projects, volunteer work, and scientific research – the options are endless. Unlike other online content managers, users retain complete ownership of all their intellectual property works stored on Scholarly Space servers.

<h3>Portfolio Generation and Export</h3>
Even though a comprehensive dynamic portfolio cannot truly be represented on paper, sometimes resumés and/or paper portfolios are necessary. With Scholarly Space, users can easily generate and export a tailored PDF or Word Document of their work. Users have nuanced control over what parts of their online portfolio they would like to include or omit in the export – granting them the ability to add or remove media, descriptions, timelines, excerpts, tags, and projects to the generated document. 

Once users build their cumulative Scholarly Space portfolio, they are able to print customized portfolios and resumés for their various specific needs. With a few clicks, users can submit these documents to local part-time jobs, full-time jobs, volunteer opportunities, and internship positions made available through the Scholarly Space site.

<h3>Portfolio Analysis</h3> 
Scholarly Space fosters curiosity and encourages exploration. It is easy not to know the overarching element that connects an individual's interests. But, with Scholarly Space's data analysis features, users can examine their portfolio's statistical trends. Users can use these features to discover potential career paths, internship opportunities, community programs, and educational institutions that match their internally-driven interests. 

<h3>A Central Hub</h3>
Scholarly Space acts as the home of a student's digital life. Our site supports integration with and connection to other EdTech companies such as PowerSchool, Edline, TurnItIn, Naviance, Khan Academy, Google Classroom, BlackBoard, Edmodo, and much more. Users can upload documents from Google Drive and link to works they keep hosted on a third-party site. Scholarly Space puts everything in one easy-to-manage place. 


<h3>Integration with Schools</h3> 
Scholarly Space works by partnering with Schools and Educational Organizations. Students and administrators of partnered schools and organizations are granted access to Scholarly Space's services. By forming partnerships, Scholarly Space can provide resources to student users that would be unavailable to the general public. For example, student's of partnered schools have the ability to explore and join various collaborative clubs and organizations, as well as enroll in discussion-based pages for class offered at their school. Students can get involved with opportunities that they were previously unaware existed. 

<h3>Collaboration and Sharing</h3> 
By default, a user's portfolio is private and can only be modified and viewed by its owner. However, users can add collaborative clubs and classes to their portfolio. These community-based classes and clubs are stored on Scholarly Space's servers and use our proprietary software. Students can submit posts and comments to these pages, which are shared with other members of the group. Comments and posts are only accessible by other members and are never shared with third parties.
 
Users of Scholarly Space also have the ability to share specific private works of their online portfolio with other Scholarly Space users using an email address. Users have the option to share these projects with various privileges – choosing to allow others to view only, view and comment only, or view and modify the work in question. Scholarly Space's sharing feature allows students to share work with their teachers, peers, and advisors. Scholarly Space facilitates a level of collaboration between students and teachers that has previously not been possible. And, by having work be private by default, student and teacher users alike can comfortably create a large online portfolio with the knowledge that their work is private and securely stored.
